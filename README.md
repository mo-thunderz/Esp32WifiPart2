# Esp32 Wifi Part2
In Part 2 we will turn the ESP32 into a simple Webserver. In addition to that Websockets will be included for continuous updates between the ESP32 and its clients. NOTE: the ESP32 only supports 2.4G networks. 5G networks will not be seen by the ESP32.

# ESP32Webserver.ino
This is a simple webserver for the ESP32. Just update the SSID and Password with that of your router, upload the INO to the ESP32 and compile. In the USB console it will provide the IP address of the ESP32 on your network. You can open a standard browser and navigate to this IP address. This will show a random number generated by the ESP32 on a simple web page. You can then alter this to show something more interesting :-)

# ESP32WebserverWebsocket.ino
Install the same way as ESP32Webserver.ino. This includes websockets for continuous updates between ESP32 and its clients.

# ESP32WifiBasic.ino (+included HTML file)
If you want to code along with the youtube video, use this folder as starting point.

# How to use:
Youtube video is in progress...


Have fun ;-)
